You can learn a few things , but more importantly , you rub shoulders with the business leaders and make contacts that could lead to potential sales or partnerships in the future . The social mixers are always more important than the seminars anyway . "

Which floor are we on now ?
How often do you meet ?
I'm too tired now . I've already worked for 12 hours overtime !

I haven't taken it yet .
" Sir , I deleted the $ 10 , but I had to add a $ 2 service charge to your bill . "
When ?
That's excellent . How have you managed that ?
" First of all , we change the motor oil and oil filter . If you don ’ t do this , it can cause your engine to wear faster and that means you would probably have to change the pistons and intake valves . "
Good plan . What should we get for Mom though ?
I bet I can go one hour in your class this morning and not feel a thing .
" At cars ! You aren't thinking about buying a car , are you ? "
I think I was wrong .
Because her children have been the age when they seem to quarrel all day long .
" Me too . Daniel , look at your left side . Can you see the Air Force Ants ? "
What ? How did that happen ?
"Oh , hi , Lily . When did you get back from Canada ? "
I'll send someone up right away .
That sounds good . Do I need to bring anything ?
it certainly is .
" One last thing , I ’ Ve decided to come out of the closet . "

" To be honest , I'm not exactly sure what we require just now . "
" Well , let me take a look at my grade book . How do YOU think you are doing ? "
" After the trouble I got into last year , no way . "
Really ? What can I do ?
" With invoking ? No , thanks . "
" I'd like to try some kebab , roasted squid , and many different appealing things . "
Have you ever driven a car before ?
I have told you that I don ’ t need them any more . The thing that really annoys me is that you played dumb with me .
Now press this button .
Thank you so much for interviewing me this evening .
All right.Let ' s go .

In Switzerland , a major avalanche was reported in the Alps . Fortunately , no one was injured . Due to to the extreme cold this winter , a blizzard has struck the US Midwest , causing classes in schools and universities to be temporarily canceled . Moving to to Latin American , Ecuador has suffered a six month drought that has not only affected farming , but has also forced the closure of the hydroelectric power plant that provides electricity for the entire country . In Chile , a major earthquake that registered seven point five on the Richter scale struck the southern region . Losses are reported to be in the billions . Authorities have not yet released an official statement . "
What ’ s the score ?
" It's not as simple as that . People judge you by your appearance , whether you like it or not . So dressing professional is being professional . The image that you portray to others is so important in business . It's your image and how others perceive you that makes the difference between landing or losing a sale . "
Is there anything I can do for you ?
