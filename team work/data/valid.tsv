0," It's a hard question , but I'm sure the reexamination of China's economic policies in the past may lead us to a right answer to the question . After the establishment of new China , our government employed numerous economics policies to stimulate the growth of China's economy . These policies , however , favored our domestic enterprises and protected them from international competition and these policies have contributed a lot to the rapid growth of both China economy and our domestic enterprises . After China's entry into TO , Chinese domestic enterprises will have to compete with their foreign counterparts . This new situation entails some changes of Chinese economic policies . These changes will spur Chinese enterprises to strengthen their competitiveness in the long run . "

4," Hi , Ms . Seymour ? It ’ s Allan Parker . I ’ Ve been waiting to call you and thank you for all your help last week . "

0, When does the cloakroom close ? 
0," I guess you're right . I've tried stopping , but I just can't seem to quit . "
0, My brother has offered me two tickets for this evening . 
0," Oh , absolutely . "
0, Three times a day after meals . 
0, What do you think is the most important thing for you to be happy ? 
0," Can I see him please , Mrs Williams ? "
4, Haha . April Fool's ! Did you forget what day it is today ? 
0, Don't worry ! Today they are wearing dresses ! 
0," Then I'd like to know your availability of the products and the terms of sales , such as mode of payment , delivery , discounts , etc . "
5, I ’ m not in the mood . 
0," It's genuine , I bet . "
0,"Craig , what do you do for work ? "
0, We always sell the best . You can believe us at this point . 
0, Okay . The sooner the better . 
0," I think I can put something together , no problem . But when it comes to tomorrow , I'll just be a bundle of nerves ! How can I get over my fear of speaking in public ? "
0," Anyway , I get the desk by the window , you get the bottom bunk . That's it . "
0, I am sorry . But I do not have any money to lend to you . 
0," well , i wanted to get a pet that wouldn't disturb the neighbors . at the same time , I wanted a pet that would be affectionate . "
0, That's perfect . I will definitely do well . 
0," Hold on , that's an item . You should put that in the recycle bin next to the trashcan . "
0," It ’ s very simple . Men shake hands , women and children don ’ t . "
0, I'll just use the ATM .

0,"Excuse me , can I deposit valuables here ? "
3, Let me have a look . Whoa ! Get away from me ! 
0," Yeah , maybe next time . "
0," No , there's a definite difference . You know , the stockholders are the people who own the company ... they're the financial control system . Then there's the CEO — the chief executive officer . He's the hot shot , the main guy who is the boss . If there is only one person with absolute power in the organization , everyone knows that the power will go to their head . It's too dangerous . That's the reason for a Board of Directors . The board is made up of people who are experts in the industry . They could be related to the organization , but more commonly , they are independent and non-biased . "
0," David , Chou . "
0," I ’ m a GS - 15 . That ’ s high on the scale of workers , but even a GS - 1 is paid a living wage . "

0,"Joanna , I will go to the outlet center . You wanna go with me ? "
0, It was 10 hours . 
4, I hope you like it .

4, I'm waiting for our President to lower the gas prices . 
0," I usually meet some friends and we play sports together or I might spend some time alone on my hobbies . I spend winter evening watching tv , but I spend summer evening at cultural events if I have time "
1,"Gordon , you're ever so late . "
0,"Excuse me , my skin is always dry , can you give me some advice ? "
0," Never mind , just read as far as you can . "
4, Thank you . 
0," Oh , yes . Several of the buildings from the villages still survive . Many of them were inns for travelers and today survive as pubs . There was a castle near one village , so our city has a castle too . "
0,Have you ever shopped at Whole Foods market ? 
0," No , Sir , I did not . "
0," I see . But , many supporters of the bailout argue that it could help save the jobs of millions of hardworking Americans . "

0,It's very dark in here . Will you turn on the light ?

0, Can we get something to drink ? We want two bottles of beer . 
0, I feel dizzy and weak . And I'm having this pain in my ear . I think I am sick . 
0," Well , it's hard to say . For the fields and rivers , winter is a relaxing season , but for farmers , I think they might take a rest physically , but mentally they are still busy thinking , planning and calculating for the working of the next year . "
0, Sure . Let ’ s go . 
0, Oh wow . How was it ? 
0,Did you vote yesterday ? 
0,Good evening . Can I help you ? 
0, Mike suggests me to return it . 
4, That's really my pleasure to listen to a Chinese song . 
0, How many carats would you like it to be ? 
0,Do you have all types of seafood here ? 
0, Do you know which account you want to take the money from ? 
0, Then what else should I put into my resume ? 
0," Oh , what a pity ! "
0,How may I help you ?
